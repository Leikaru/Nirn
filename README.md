# Nirn

## An Introduction
Nirn is a mod for Europa Universalis IV which attempts to convert the entire world of The Elder Scrolls into the game. Whilst a difficult challenge, it is a challenge which is most certainly worth taking.

This mod is set during the second era, in a time known as the Interregnum (about 300 years before the events of The Elder Scrolls Online, which will likely be the mods final bookmark). This is a period in which many minor nations exist throughout Tamriel, as the continent lies in disarray after the assassination of the Tsaesci Potentate. It is one of the few times in the history of Tamriel where more than 5 nations existed at one time, and so for that reason, our mod is set then.

Further information on the mod can be found on the wiki.
