  desc_individualism:0 "Individualism is a new idealogy in Tamriel. The idea simply suggests that indepedence and freedom are crucial to this world. People are now believing this more than ever, and so have decided that they would like to see Individualism in action, and so, many have declared independence. This has meant that many petty nations have formed in what was once a powerful kingdom, allowing the powerful kingdoms which have stood together to be stronger than ever before. It has also allowed for some once minor threats to become much more major than usual, allowing once minor nations to become great powers in their own right."

Rulership has been a minor factor for many years, and has allowed barbarians such as the Orcs and the Reachmen to thrive, and own large swathes of territory. However, now that the threat is too high, people are beginning to realise that the time has come for the civilized folk of the world to take action, and stop the barbarians from being a threat anymore."

The ancestors of the Nords were seen as barbarians when they first set foot on Tamriel, and since then have been seen similarly by Elves of the present. In the Reach, the Reachmen continue to be rejected by society, as everywhere ignores their claim of legitimacy. They are a babarous nation through and through. Yet these Reachmen also possess great power. They are not weak, not at all, and a continuing to rise in the political turmoil, as they are uniting quickly, and rather worryingly..."

  nirn_institutions.2.d:0 "The year $YEAR$ is a good year for most of Tamriel. In High Rock, the civilized Breton folk have come up with the perfect solution to the ongoing spread of barbarism; to simply embrace the idea of civilized rulership, and have people from across Tamriel living under a set guide of civil laws which they must obey. Additionally, all reigning monarchs must also help embrace this new idealogy, as they must rule with a strong iron fist, and help finally put an end to the barbarian menaces!"

Rumours even spread that they are now taking advantage of magic never seen before, such as even donating their mortality to the Old Gods, in return for power never seen before. Their intimidating nature has only increased, as the regions of High Rock and Skyrim lie unstable, waiting to see if the Reachmen will strike. The dark ages of Barbarism have begun, and it looks like it may never have an end..."
