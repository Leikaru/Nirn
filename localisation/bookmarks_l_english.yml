  INTERREGNUM_NAME:0 "§G2E 582§!: The Interregnum"
  INTERREGNUM_DESC:0 "The Imperial Throne lies empty. The Tsaesci Potentates have been assassinated. Tamriel lies in chaos, with everyone wanting to claim the throne that once ruled almost all of Tamriel. Nothing is stable. There is a constant state of war, ranging from the wild province of Valenwood to the rich province of Cyrodiil. Once strong powerful kingdoms have devolved in petty nations squabbling for land which was once part of an Empire so strong almost all races bent to their command. However, some provinces remain untouched. The province of Alinor remains unified and stable, with no threats other than the Maormer to the south, and Morrowind remains united under the influence of the Tribunal. The real question is... who will ascend onto the Ruby Throne?"
