# Contributing to Nirn

## Contributing to Nirn
To contribute to the project, you simply have to follow these simple steps, and then you will have contributed and helped make the project better.

1. Fork the Project
  - This is so that you don't commit directly to the project, as that would be messy and lead to all kinds of things going wrong.
  - Additionally, it helps us so that we know who is working on what, and where they are working on it.
  
2. Clone the Project
  - This was probably expected, but to make changes to your fork, you need to clone it onto your desktop. I recommend either learning how to use the git shell, or use some UI that works for you.
  
3. Make a branch for your new feature.
  - This is mostly a 'just in case' thing, but if you suddenly have to shift work towards a bug which is breaking the game, then you would need to stop work. It keeps is tidy, and it helps you know where you are at still.
  
4. Make your changes
  - Don't make any changes that aren't necessary or needed, as when you make the pull request it'll simply get turned down and so just add unnecessary pull requests. See the [Contribution Guidelines](#contribution-guidelines) for information on how you should be contributing.
  - Please make sure you notify us if the you change any defines file, as we want to avoid making too many merge conflicts. If you don't have to edit a file, **don't do it**.
 
5. Commit to your branch.

6. Sort out any conflicts you may have with the main master branch.
  - If there are ever any merge conflicts, you are considered the one reponsible, and so you must be the one to fix the issue.

7. Make a pull request here.
  - Explain it, document it, and make sure it works.

8. Wait.
  - After making a pull request, you might have to wait a bit before it is merged. It may also require discussion, which you will need to actively participate in, as otherwise we will simply not accept your pull request. It's important your active, and willing to explain what you have done. It should get accepted, if you have followed everything correctly.
 
### Contribution Guidelines
These are basic guidelines on how to help the project. This applies almost all the time (take it up with a Head Developer in Discord if you want/need an exception)

- **Please only work on features which are needed for the next release**
  - In order to make sure that we are all on the same page, you absolutely must check the Projects which are in progress, and see what needs to be worked on before our first release. This means that if you have an idea you want to put in. We don't want unnecessary changes.
  - The only exception to this rule is when you are fixing a minor bug. However, if the bug is on the projects page, please make sure that you assign yourself to it.
 
- **Assign yourself to the thing you are working on**
  - In order to make sure we know who is working on what, we would prefer it if you assigned yourself the issue. Then we know it is taken.
  - As well as this, please move the issue to the 'Work in Progress' category, as that way we can see what it being worked on and what isn't. Again, keep things clean.
  
- **Make sure your pull requests are well checked and documented**
  - When making a pull request, please make sure you have checked for bugs, and made sure it works. We don't want anything to create more bugs than necessary, so please try to keep that number down.
  - Document your changes well. If you don't document your changes, then chances are it'll be difficult to merge the request, as we won't have a clue what it does. Including screenshots helps a ton as well, if you can that is.
